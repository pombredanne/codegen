#codegen
codegen is a tool for automating the creation of new source code files, by ensuring that they have the required license's inserted at the start of the code, correct names, includes and basic components you would want to have
in each source code file.

###Why?
This tool is more intended for use in my own projects, though other people are more than welcome to make use of, add to and contribute to this tool if they find it useful or think that they would.
